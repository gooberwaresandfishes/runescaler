~~Originally much more polish (sounds, menus, better level design) was intended as well as a couple more levels and a boss battle, i have updated the game to include some of these and will upload the zip after the jam is done. Overall i'm still relatively pleased with how the game is in the state it was uploaded to the jam.~~
its now good enough got a decent amount of polish

## Controls

WASD or arrow keys to move

E to pick up items

LEFT CLICK to throw items

RIGHT CLICK to use items

R to restart the level

H to view Zebolios' rune research


## Help

Avoid the red blocks.

Throwing runes on objects makes them shrink or grow.

Runes have different effects based on their appearance

Be careful of monsters, unless you're bigger than them

Consult Zebolios' Rune Research to check the properties of runes.


## Issues

~~I was a bit late to the jam so i spent less than 48 hours making this game, this was also my first game jam and the game was written in c without an engine (it was also the first game I've ever made in c),
due to these restraints the game has been submitted with a lack of polish and a couple notable issues, most of these are gone or better on the downloaded version.~~

~~On level 2 and 4 its difficult to jump through the door (but it is possible)~~

~~On web standing on boxes often causes you to be teleported back or forward (this is fixed on download)~~

~~When walking into a box your player sprite kinda just freaks out, this is fixed but was fixed after the jam was done, its mostly a visual glitch so it should be fine.~~

~~On web your jump is way too high (likely due to me not handling delta time stuff correctly)~~

these are pretty much fixed


## Story

The evil wizard Zebolios has discovered the power of scaling runes and trapped Jeb the Giant in his lair to experiment on him; luckily, he left his runes scattered all over the place...
